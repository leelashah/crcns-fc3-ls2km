# PSYC 5270 Final Project: Analyzing EEG data in Python

This repository contains data taken from the crcns website. The repository contains human scalp EEG data collected from 14 patients with unilateral prefrontal cortex lesions and 20 age- and education-matched, healthy controls. The dataset was originally contributed by Elizabeth Johnson.

## Data organization

2 of the data files, the ones labeled "ctrl01.tar.gz" and "pfc02.tar.gz", were downloaded from the crcns website into the folder "crcns" created in the documents portion of my local drive. Then, once the directory crcns-fc3-ls2km was created, the files were transferred to subdirectory named "data." The names of the files were not changed upon downloading them from the crcns website.
