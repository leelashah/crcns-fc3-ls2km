# PSYC 5270 Final Project: Analyzing EEG data in Python

This repository contains data taken from the crcns website. The repository contains a dataset of 7 EEG scans, performed intracranially of the lateral and intraparietal areas of the brain during working memory tasks. The dataset was originally contributed by Elizabeth Johnson.

## Data organization

The 7 data files were downloaded from the crcns website into the folder "crcns" created in the documents portion of my local drive. Then, once the directory crcns-fc3-ls2km was created, the files were transferred to subdirectory named "data." The names of the files were not changed upon downloading them from the crcns website, and were named "s1.tar" - "s7.tar".
